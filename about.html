                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>ReBOTTLE was designed and founded by Shani Almagor in 2016. This is a love story -When I first came
                    to live Portugal in 2013 I was overwhelmed with its beauty. I was absolutely amazed by the wonderful
                    cork oak forest we had on the land, a kind of trees that grow not only leaves and fruits but also an
                    incredibly gorgeous regenerative skin, perfectly fitting endless usages. I fell in love. I started
                    investigating deep into this ancient local tradition and craft: curious about its history, the
                    qualities of the material, the ways in which it is harvested and processed, the people that made it
                    their living and its impact on the local economy. My curiosity lead me to a life changing encounter
                    with Antonio, a local craft-man with a small workshop in his backyard who works with cork for over
                    30 years and has a lot of experience. We started a designer-maker collaboration. I started
                    experimenting with cork out of pure attraction, fun and playful discovery but my friendsâ€™ reactions
                    to our early creations made me realise I wanted to make it available for all to appreciate, utilise
                    and enjoy.
                    In 2016 ReBOTTLE was born, it is a premium quality stainless-steel, reusable water bottle covered
                    with cork. The cork coating is handcrafted by local artisans using a natural eco-friendly local
                    resource, re-embracing tradition and quality with a beautiful and practical design that is hip and
                    fashionable.</p>

                <h1>VISION</h1>
                <p>A sustainable life is all about mutual support and harmony, it's about conscious awareness of the
                    impact we make on our environment.
                    A sustainable business is one that sustains the livelihood of its owners, provides fair working
                    conditions for those who need it, avoid harm and aspires to make good. A business that should evolve
                    in a conscious and organic way, placing sustainable principles before profit or growth.</p>

                <h1>MISSION</h1>
                <p>As for ReBOTTLE, I made it my mission to encourage the reduction of using toxic, single use plastic
                    articles and offer instead durable reusable alternatives that leave minimal ecological footprint
                    while helping encourage local economy here in Portugal.
                    I design and create useful, practical, functional unique and original designs for a better,
                    healthier and cleaner planet while improving our own lifestyle.</p>

                <h1>ACTION</h1>
                <p>I care to contribute to the local economy and to the preservation of traditional skills and
                    knowledge, by using local traditional materials and techniques in a modern unique design. Our
                    products are handcrafted by local artisans.

                    We are giving back - We are planting trees where trees can have the most beneficial impact, by
                    bringing Nature to urban places we connect the world to nature and creating a better and greener
                    tomorrow, we provide education for students and communities about the role of trees in the
                    environment and we share knowledge about the importance of cork oak forest and desertification.

                    We aspire to help and support the Regeneration of cork oak forest that is preventing desertification
                    and wildfires in Portugal. Buying products that are made from natural cork helps to keep cork
                    forests alive. We'd love for you to join us!</p>
